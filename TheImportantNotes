The BIG o notation 
to find only the first element in a big data we use  O  (O)1 this is usually for that element whose index is known by the one who want to get that element
(O)n is used when you want to find some certain data which as on certain index means if that data is on index 500 then you have to cycle 500times 

(o)n^2 is used when you have to compare a data from some other data then that will take the squre  of that's index(the element on which you are performing the operation...


if you are extracting the data and you know where its located in the index then  the complexity would be (o)1

when you push(adding the element in the array on the end) and pop (removing the element from the end) the complexity will (o)1

when  you shift(removing element form the start of the array) and unshift(add  the element on the start

of the array)  the complexity become(O)n
